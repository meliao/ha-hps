	abstract = {This paper presents a direct solution technique for the scattering of time-harmonic waves from a bounded region of the plane in which the wavenumber varies smoothly in space. The method constructs the interior Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map for the bounded region via bottom-up recursive merges of (discretization of) certain boundary operators on a quadtree of boxes. These operators take the form of impedance-to-impedance (ItI) maps. Since ItI maps are unitary, this formulation is inherently numerically stable, and is immune to problems of artificial internal resonances. The ItI maps on the smallest (leaf) boxes are built by spectral collocation on tensor-product grids of Chebyshev nodes. At the top level the DtN map is recovered from the ItI map and coupled to a boundary integral formulation of the free space exterior problem, to give a provably second kind equation. Numerical results indicate that the scheme can solve challenging problems 70 wavelengths on a side to 9-digit accuracy with 4 million unknowns, in under 5 min on a desktop workstation. Each additional solve corresponding to a different incident wave (right-hand side) then requires only 0.04 s.},

It is very efficient and robust for solving Maxwell eigenvalue problems since the method reduces solutions of fine eigenvalue problems to a series of solutions of parallel preconditioned systems and Helmholtz projected systems. After solving a small dimensional eigenvalue problem in a trial subspace, we finally get the total error reduction of the first several discrete eigenvalues as , where  is a positive parameter,  is the overlapping size among subdomains, and  is the diameter of subdomains. The positive number  is independent of the mesh size  and internal gaps among the first several Maxwell eigenvalues, i.e., the method is optimal corresponding to the degrees of freedom and cluster robust. The number  increases with  increasing, and decreases with  increasing. The -dependent constant  decreases monotonically to 1 as , which means the more the number of subdomains, the better the convergence rate. Numerical results supporting our theory are given.},

The scheme decomposes the domain into thin subdomains, or “slabs” and uses a two-level approach that is designed with parallelization in mind. The scheme takes advantage of \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{H\}\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}textbf\{2\}\$\$-matrix structure emerging during factorization and utilizes randomized algorithms to efficiently recover this structure. As opposed to multi-level nested dissection schemes that incorporate the use of \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{H\}\}\$\$or \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{H\}\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}textbf\{2\}\$\$matrices for a hierarchy of front sizes, SlabLU is a two-level scheme which only uses \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{{\textbackslash}mathcal \{H\}\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}textbf\{2\}\$\$-matrix algebra for fronts of roughly the same size. The simplicity allows the scheme to be easily tuned for performance on modern architectures and GPUs. The solver described is compatible with a range of different local discretizations, and numerical experiments demonstrate its performance for regular discretizations of rectangular and curved geometries. The technique becomes particularly efficient when combined with very high-order accurate multidomain spectral collocation schemes. With this discretization, a Helmholtz problem on a domain of size \$\${\textbackslash}textbf\{1000\} {\textbackslash}varvec\{{\textbackslash}lambda \} {\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}textbf\{1000\} {\textbackslash}varvec\{{\textbackslash}lambda \}\$\$(for which \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{N\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathbf \{=100\} {\textbackslash}textbf\{M\}\$\$) is solved in 15 min to 6 correct digits on a high-powered desktop with GPU acceleration.},

Burstedde, L. Wilcox, O. Ghattas, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 2011). Within each Cartesian patch, stored in leaves of the quadtree, we use a second order finite volume discretization on cell-centered meshes.

We demonstrate our solver on Poisson and Helmholtz problems with a mesh adapted to the high local curvature of the right-hand side.},

	abstract = {A high fidelity flow simulation for complex geometries for high Reynolds number (Re) flow is still very challenging, requiring a more powerful HPC system. However, the development of HPC with traditional CPU architecture suffers bottlenecks due to its high power consumption and technical difficulties. Heterogeneous architecture computation is raised to be a promising solution to the challenges of HPC development. GPU accelerating technology has been utilized in low order scheme CFD solvers on the structured grid and high order scheme solvers on unstructured meshes. The high-order finite difference methods on structured grids possess many advantages, e.g., high efficiency, robustness, and low storage. However, the strong dependence among points for a high-order finite difference scheme still limits its application on the GPU platform. In the present work, we propose a set of hardware-aware technology to optimize data transfer efficiency between CPU and GPU, as well as communication efficiency among GPUs. An in-house multi-block structured CFD solver with high order finite difference methods on curvilinear coordinates is ported onto the GPU platform and obtains satisfying performance with a speedup maximum of around 2000x over a single CPU core. This work provides an efficient solution to apply GPU computing in CFD simulation with specific high order finite difference methods on current GPU heterogeneous computers.

	abstract = {Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are widely employed to describe natural phenomena in many science and engineering fields. Many PDEs do not have analytical solutions, hence, numerical methods have become prevalent for approximating PDE solutions. The most widely used numerical method is the Finite Difference Method (FDM), which requires fine grids and high-precision numerical iterations that are both compute- and memory-intensive. PDE-solving accelerators have been proposed in the literature, however, they usually focus on specific types of PDEs with rigid grid sizes which limits their broader applicability. Besides, they rarely provided insight into the optimizations of parallel computing and data accesses for solving PDEs, which hinders further improvements in performance and energy efficiency.This paper presents FDMAX, an elastic accelerator to efficiently support FDM for different types of PDEs with any grid size. FDMAX employs a customized Processing Element (PE) array architecture that maximizes data reuse with minimized interconnection overhead. The PE array can be reconfigured to break into a set of subarrays to adapt to different grid sizes for optimal efficiency. Moreover, the PE array exploits computation and data reuse for increased performance and energy efficiency, and is reconfigurable to support a wide range of PDEs such as elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations. Evaluated on four well-known PDEs, our simulation results show that FDMAX achieves on average 1189× speedup with 1123× energy reduction over Intel Xeon CPU, and 4.9× speedup with 6.3× energy reduction over NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU, and 2.9× speedup over Alrescha, the state-of-the-art PDE-solving accelerator.},

	abstract = {In contrast to the positive definite Helmholtz equation, the deceivingly similar looking indefinite Helmholtz equation is difficult to solve using classical iterative methods. Simply using a Krylov method is much less effective, especially when the wave number in the Helmholtz operator becomes large, and also algebraic preconditioners such as incomplete LU factorizations do not remedy the situation. Even more powerful preconditioners such as classical domain decomposition and multigrid methods fail to lead to a convergent method, and often behave differently from their usual behavior for positive definite problems. For example increasing the overlap in a classical Schwarz method degrades its performance, as does increasing the number of smoothing steps in multigrid. The purpose of this review paper is to explain why classical iterative methods fail to be effective for Helmholtz problems, and to show different avenues that have been taken to address this difficulty.},

In our method, a well-posed boundary integral formulation is used to ensure the fast convergence of Krylov subspace based linear algebraic solver such as the GMRES. The molecular surfaces are discretized with flat triangles and centroid collocation. To speed up our method, we take advantage of the parallel nature of the boundary integral formulation and parallelize the schemes within CUDA shared memory architecture on GPU. The schemes use only 11N+6Nc size-of-double device memory for a biomolecule with N triangular surface elements and Nc partial charges. Numerical tests of these schemes show well-maintained accuracy and fast convergence. The GPU implementation using one GPU card (Nvidia Tesla M2070) achieves 120–150X speed-up to the implementation using one CPU (Intel L5640 2.27 GHz). With our approach, solving PB equations on well-discretized molecular surfaces with up to 300,000 boundary elements will take less than about 10 min, hence our approach is particularly suitable for fast electrostatics computations on small to medium biomolecules.},

This is particularly true when used with continuous finite elements.Herein, we discuss algorithms that are necessary for a comprehensive and generic implementation of hp-adaptive finite element methods on distributed-memory, parallel machines. In particular, we will present a multistage algorithm for the unique enumeration of degrees of freedom suitable for continuous finite element spaces, describe considerations for weighted load balancing, and discuss the transfer of variable size data between processes. We illustrate the performance of our algorithms with numerical examples and demonstrate that they scale reasonably up to at least 16,384 message passage interface processes.We provide a reference implementation of our algorithms as part of the open source library deal.II.},

Firstly, we demonstrate that complete waveforms which cover the inspiral, merger, and ringdown of binary black holes (i.e., IMRPhenomD) can be written in JAX and demonstrate that the serial evaluation speed of the waveform (and its derivative) is similar to the lalsuite implementation in C. Moreover, JAX allows for graphics processing unit–accelerated waveform calls which can be over an order of magnitude faster than serial evaluation on a CPU. We then focus on three applications where efficient and differentiable waveforms are essential. Firstly, we demonstrate how gradient descent can be used to optimize the ∼200 coefficients that are used to calibrate the waveform model. In particular, we demonstrate that the typical match with numerical relativity waveforms can be improved by more than 50\%. Secondly, we show that Fisher forecasting calculations can be sped up by ∼3–5 × (on a CPU) with no loss in accuracy. This increased speed makes Fisher forecasting for a population of events substantially simpler. Finally, we show that gradient-based samplers like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo lead to significantly reduced autocorrelation values when compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods. Since differentiable waveforms have substantial advantages for a variety of tasks throughout GW science, we propose that waveform developers use JAX to build new waveforms moving forward. Our waveform code, ripple, can be found on GitHub website and will continue to be updated with new waveforms as they are implemented.},

	abstract = {We have ported the numerical factorization and triangular solve phases of the sparse direct solver STRUMPACK to GPU. STRUMPACK implements sparse LU factorization using the multifrontal algorithm, which performs most of its operations in dense linear algebra operations on so-called frontal matrices of various sizes. Our GPU implementation off-loads these dense linear algebra operations, as well as the sparse scatter–gather operations between frontal matrices. For the larger frontal matrices, our GPU implementation relies on vendor libraries such as cuBLAS and cuSOLVER for NVIDIA GPUs and rocBLAS and rocSOLVER for AMD GPUs. For the smaller frontal matrices we developed custom CUDA and HIP kernels to reduce kernel launch overhead. Overall, high performance is achieved by identifying submatrix factorizations corresponding to sub-trees of the multifrontal assembly tree which fit entirely in GPU memory. The multi-GPU setting uses SLATE (Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale) as a modern GPU-aware replacement for ScaLAPACK. On 4 nodes of SUMMIT the code runs ∼10× faster when using all 24 V100 GPUs compared to when it only uses the 168 POWER9 cores. On 8 SUMMIT nodes, using 48 V100 GPUs, the sparse solver reaches over 50TFlop/s. Compared to SuperLU, on a single V100, for a set of 17 matrices our implementation is faster for all but one matrix, and is on average 5× (median 4×) faster},

	abstract = {Wave behavior underlies useful technologies such as active sonar, passive sonar, and echolocation. For instance, wave behavior is used to determine the sonar signature of underwater vehicles for stealth designs. To obtain a sonar signature, the fastest method is to simulate a sonar testbed using physics software. However, these software rely on the finite element method or finite difference method, which are slow due to their dependence on explicit computations. To overcome this issue, researchers have begun developing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to learn wave behavior. As PINNs rely on soft computing and act as operators, they can learn from noisy data and make quick predictions. Our PINN differs from other PINNs that are trained on static simulation grids with open boundaries. The goal of our PINN is to predict the reflection of a pressure wave off of a dynamic obstruction in an arbitrary grid, mimicking in part, the behavior of active sonar. Given a random source location, static obstructions, and a dynamic obstruction, the PINN predicted the wave evolution for 500 timesteps in 1.54 seconds and was over 1200 times faster than the finite difference method. The PINN was trained using supervised and unsupervised learning and reached a mean squared error of 3E-5. Results show that the PINN demonstrates visual and numerical accuracy and avoids learning unwanted artifacts like spurious waves, due to its ability to generalize. For future work, we will add more degrees of freedom to define complex dynamic obstruction shapes.},

The factorization itself also scales linearly with the system size, albeit with a somewhat larger constant. The scheme is built on a level-restricted adaptive octree data structure, and therefore, it is compatible with highly nonuniform discretizations. Furthermore, the scheme is coupled with high-order accurate locally-corrected Nyström quadrature methods to integrate the singular and weakly-singular Green’s functions used in the integral representations. Our method has immediate applications to a variety of problems in computational physics.

	abstract = {In this computational paper, we focused on the efficient numerical implementation of semi-implicit methods for models in materials science. In particular, we were interested in a class of nonlinear higher-order parabolic partial differential equations. The Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equation was chosen as a benchmark problem for our proposed methods. We first considered the Cahn-Hilliard equation with a convexity-splitting (CS) approach coupled with a backward Euler approximation of the time derivative and tested the performance against the bi-harmonic-modified (BHM) approach in terms of accuracy, order of convergence, and computation time. Higher-order time-stepping techniques that allow for the methods to increase their accuracy and order of convergence were then introduced. The proposed schemes in this paper were found to be very efficient for 2D computations. Computed dynamics in 2D and 3D are presented to demonstrate the energy-decreasing property and overall performance of the methods for longer simulation runs with a variety of initial conditions. In addition, we also present a simple yet powerful way to accelerate the computations by using MATLAB built-in commands to perform GPU implementations of the schemes. We show that it is possible to accelerate computations for the CH equation in 3D by a factor of 80, provided the hardware is capable enough.},

We develop a fast algorithm for solving three-dimensional Helmholtz boundary problems with large wave numbers. The boundary of computational domain is discrete based on high-order compact difference scheme. Using the properties of the tensor product and the discrete Fourier sine transform method, the original problem is solved by splitting it into independent small tridiagonal subsystems. Numerical examples with impedance boundary conditions are used to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. Results demonstrate that the algorithm has a fourth- order convergence in and -norms, and costs less CPU calculation time and random access memory.},

            This paper introduces the hierarchical interpolative factorization for elliptic partial differential equations (HIF‐DE) in two (2D) and three dimensions (3D). This factorization takes the form of an approximate generalized LU/LDL decomposition that facilitates the efficient inversion of the discretized operator. HIF‐DE is based on the nested dissection multifrontal method but uses skeletonization on the separator fronts to sparsify the dense frontal matrices and thus reduce the cost. We conjecture that this strategy yields linear complexity in 2D and quasilinear complexity in 3D. Estimated linear complexity in 3D can be achieved by skeletonizing the compressed fronts themselves, which amounts geometrically to a recursive dimensional reduction scheme. Numerical experiments support our claims and further demonstrate the performance of our algorithm as a fast direct solver and preconditioner.

	abstract = {Therapeutic ultrasound is a promising non-invasive method for inducing various beneficial biological effects in the human body. In cancer treatment applications, high-power ultrasound is focused at a target tissue volume to ablate the malignant tumour. The success of the procedure depends on the ability to accurately focus ultrasound and destroy the target tissue volume through coagulative necrosis whilst preserving the surrounding healthy tissue. Patient-specific treatment planning strategies are therefore being developed to increase the efficacy of such therapies, while reducing any damage to healthy tissue. These strategies require to use high-performance computing methods to solve ultrasound wave propagation in the body quickly and accurately. For realistic clinical scenarios, all numerical methods which employ volumetric meshes require several hours or days to solve the full-wave propagation on a computer cluster. The boundary element method (BEM) is an efficient approach for modelling the wave field because only the boundaries of the hard and soft tissue regions require discretisation. This paper presents a multiple-domain BEM formulation with a novel preconditioner for solving the Helmholtz transmission problem (HTP). This new formulation is efficient at high-frequencies and where high-contrast materials are present. Numerical experiments are performed to solve the HTP in multiple domains comprising: (i) human ribs, an idealised abdominal fat layer and liver tissue, (ii) a human kidney with a perinephric fat layer, exposed to the acoustic field generated by a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) array transducer. The time required to solve the equations associated with these problems on a single workstation is of the order of minutes. These results demonstrate the great potential of this new BEM formulation for accurately and quickly solving ultrasound wave propagation problems in large anatomical domains which is essential for developing treatment planning strategies.},

We first train a deep neural operator (DeepONet) as a foundation model to solve wave propagation problems described by the Helmholtz equation in a domain without scatterers but at different wavenumbers and with a complex absorbing boundary condition. We then design two classes of ultra-fast meta-solvers by combining DeepONet with either relaxation methods, such as Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel, or with Krylov methods, such as GMRES and BiCGStab, using the trunk basis of DeepONet as a coarse-scale preconditioner. We leverage the spectral bias of neural networks to account for the lower part of the spectrum in the error distribution while the upper part is handled inexpensively using relaxation methods or fine-scale preconditioners.We first demonstrate that the resulting meta-solvers are shape-agnostic, fast, and robust, whereas the standard standalone solvers may even fail to converge without the DeepONet. We then apply both classes of meta-solvers to scattering from a submarine, a complex three-dimensional problem. We achieve ultra-fast solutions, especially with the DeepONet-Krylov methods, which require orders of magnitude fewer iterations than any of the standalone solvers.},

Constructed on top of Google JAX, a rising machine learning library focusing on high-performance numerical computing, JAX-FEM is implemented with pure Python while scalable to efficiently solve problems with moderate to large sizes. For example, in a 3D tensile loading problem with 7.7 million degrees of freedom, JAX-FEM with GPU achieves around 10× acceleration compared to a commercial FEM code depending on platform. Beyond efficiently solving forward problems, JAX-FEM employs the automatic differentiation technique so that inverse problems are solved in a fully automatic manner without the need to manually derive sensitivities. Examples of 3D topology optimization of nonlinear materials are shown to achieve optimal compliance. Finally, JAX-FEM is an integrated platform for machine learning-aided computational mechanics. We show an example of data-driven multi-scale computations of a composite material where JAX-FEM provides an all-in-one solution from microscopic data generation and model training to macroscopic FE computations. The source code of the library and these examples are shared with the community to facilitate computational mechanics research.

The new version uses a modified tensor product basis which is more efficient and stable than previous versions. The adaptive technique exploits the tensor product nature of the basis functions to create a criterion for determining which parts of the domain require additional refinement.

Second, touching as well as overlapping subdomains are supported; both rectangular blocks with Chebyshev basis functions as well as spherical shells with an expansion in spherical harmonics are implemented. Third, the code is very flexible: The domain decomposition as well as the distribution of collocation points in each domain can be chosen at run time, and the solver is easily adaptable to new PDEs.

The fact that the solver is direct is a principal feature of the scheme, and makes it particularly well suited to solving problems for which iterative solvers struggle; in particular for problems with highly oscillatory solutions. Numerical examples demonstrate that the scheme is fast and highly accurate. For instance, using a discretization with 12 points per wavelength, a Helmholtz problem on a domain of size 100×100 wavelengths was solved to ten correct digits. The computation was executed on a standard laptop; it involved 1.6M degrees of freedom and required 100 s for the pre-computation, and 0.3 s for the actual solve.},

Unlike previous skeletonization-based factorizations, RS-S uses a simple modification of skeletonization, strong skeletonization, which compresses only far-field interactions.  This leads to an approximate factorization in the form of a product of many block unit-triangular matrices that may be used as a preconditioner or moderate-accuracy direct solver, with dramatically reduced rank growth.  We further combine the strong skeletonization procedure with alternating near-field compression to obtain the hybrid recursive skeletonization factorization (RS-WS), a modification of RS-S that exhibits reduced storage cost in many settings.  Under suitable rank assumptions both RS-S and RS-WS exhibit linear computational complexity, which we demonstrate with a number of numerical examples.},

The key idea is to apply the sweeping preconditioner recursively to the quasi-two-dimensional auxiliary problems introduced in the three-dimensional (3D) sweeping preconditioner. Compared to the nonrecursive 3D sweeping preconditioner, the setup cost of this new approach drops from \$O(N{\textasciicircum}\{4/3\})\$ to \$O(N)\$, the application cost per iteration drops from \$O(N{\textbackslash}log N)\$ to \$O(N)\$, and the iteration count increases only mildly when combined with the standard GMRES solver. Several numerical examples are tested and the results are compared with the nonrecursive sweeping preconditioner to demonstrate the efficiency of the new approach.},

Domain decomposition methods (DDM) constitute today an important category of methods for the solution of highly demanding problems in simulation-based applied science and engineering. Among them, dual domain decomposition methods have been successfully applied in a variety of problems in both sequential as well as in parallel/distributed processing systems. In this work, we demonstrate the implementation of the FETI method to a hybrid CPU–GPU computing environment. Parametric tests on implicit finite element structural mechanics benchmark problems revealed the tremendous potential of this type of hybrid computing environment as a result of the full exploitation of multi-core CPU hardware resources and the intrinsic software and hardware features of the GPUs as well as the numerical properties of the solution method.},

As the era of Moore’s law draws to a close, many new non–von Neumann processors are emerging as potential computational accelerators, including those based on the principles of neuromorphic computing, tensor algebra, and quantum information. While development of these new processors is continuing to mature, the potential impact on accelerated computing is anticipated to be profound. We discuss how different processing models can advance computing in key scientific paradigms: machine learning and constraint satisfaction. Significantly, each of these new processor types utilizes a fundamentally different model of computation, and this raises questions about how to best use such processors in the design and implementation of applications. While many processors are being developed with a specific domain target, the ubiquity of spin-glass models and neural networks provides an avenue for multi-functional applications. This also hints at the infrastructure needed to integrate next-generation processing units into future high-performance computing systems.},

	abstract = {Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5x higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.},

	abstract = {This article presents novel numerical algorithms based on pseudodifferential operators for fast, direct, solution of the Helmholtz equation in one-, two- and three-dimensional inhomogeneous unbounded media. The proposed approach relies on an Operator Fourier Transform (OFT) representation of pseudodifferential operators (ΨDO) which frame the problem of computing the inverse Helmholtz operator, with a spatially-dependent wave speed, in terms of two sequential applications of an inverse square root pseudodifferential operator. The OFT representation of the action of the inverse square root pseudodifferential operator, in turn, can be effected as a superposition of solutions of a pseudo-temporal initial-boundary-value problem for a paraxial equation. The OFT framework offers several advantages over traditional direct and iterative approaches for the solution of the Helmholtz equation. The operator integral transform is amenable to standard quadrature methods and the required pseudo-temporal paraxial equation solutions can be obtained using any suitable numerical method. A specialized quadrature is derived to evaluate the OFT efficiently and an alternating direction implicit method, used in conjunction with standard finite differences, is used to solve the requisite component paraxial equation problems. Numerical studies, in one, two, and three spatial dimensions, are presented to confirm the expected OFT-based Helmholtz solver convergence rate. In addition, the efficiency and versatility of our proposed approach is demonstrated by tackling nontrivial wave propagation problems, including two-dimensional plane wave scattering from a geometrically complex inhomogeneity, three-dimensional scattering from turbulent channel flow and plane wave transmission through a spherically-symmetric gradient-index Luneburg lens. All computations, even three-dimensional problems which involve solving the Helmholtz equation with more than one billion complex unknowns, are performed in a single workstation.},

The method is designed for problems with smooth solutions, and is based on a multidomain spectral collocation discretization scheme. The resulting system of linear equations can very efficiently be solved using a nested dissection style direct (as opposed to iterative) solver. This makes the scheme particularly well suited to solving problems for which iterative solvers struggle; in particular for problems with oscillatory solutions. A principal feature of the scheme is that once the solution operator has been constructed, the actual solve is extremely fast. An upper bound on the asymptotic cost of the build stage of O(N4/3) is proved (for the case where the PDE is held fixed as N increases). The solve stage has close to linear complexity. The scheme requires a relatively large amount of storage per degree of freedom, but since it is a high order scheme, a small number of degrees of freedom is sufficient to achieve high accuracy. The method is presented for the case where there is no body load present, but it can with little difficulty be generalized to the non-homogeneous case. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the scheme is capable of solving Helmholtz-type equations on a domain of size 20×20×20 wavelengths to three correct digits on a modest personal workstation, with N≈2⋅106.},

	abstract = {An efficient direct solver for solving the Lippmann–Schwinger integral equation modeling acoustic scattering in the plane is presented. For a problem with N degrees of freedom, the solver constructs an approximate inverse in \${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(N{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\})\$operations and then, given an incident field, can compute the scattered field in \${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(N {\textbackslash}log N)\$operations. The solver is based on a previously published direct solver for integral equations that relies on rank-deficiencies in the off-diagonal blocks; specifically, the so-called Hierarchically Block Separable format is used. The particular solver described here has been reformulated in a way that improves numerical stability and robustness, and exploits the particular structure of the kernel in the Lippmann–Schwinger equation to accelerate the computation of an approximate inverse. The solver is coupled with a Nyström discretization on a regular square grid, using a quadrature method developed by Ran Duan and Vladimir Rokhlin that attains high-order accuracy despite the singularity in the kernel of the integral equation. A particularly efficient solver is obtained when the direct solver is run at four digits of accuracy, and is used as a preconditioner to GMRES, with each forwards application of the integral operators accelerated by the FFT. Extensive numerical experiments are presented that illustrate the high performance of the method in challenging environments. Using the 10th-order accurate version of the Duan–Rokhlin quadrature rule, the scheme is capable of solving problems on domains that are over 500 wavelengths wide to relative error below 10− 10 in a couple of hours on a workstation, using 26M degrees of freedom.},

	abstract = {Summary: In this work, we present a CUDA-based GPU implementation of a Poisson–Boltzmann equation solver, in both the linear and non-linear versions, using double precision. A finite difference scheme is adopted and made suitable for the GPU architecture. The resulting code was interfaced with the electrostatics software for biomolecules DelPhi, which is widely used in the computational biology community. The algorithm has been implemented using CUDA and tested over a few representative cases of biological interest. Details of the implementation and performance test results are illustrated. A speedup of ∼10 times was achieved both in the linear and non-linear cases.Availability and implementation: The module is open-source and available at http://www.electrostaticszone.eu/index.php/downloads.Contact:  walter.rocchia@iit.itSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online},

	abstract = {An efficient algorithm is presented for the numerical solution of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation by the finite difference method of successive over-relaxation. Improvements include the rapid estimation of the optimum relaxation parameter, reduction in number of operations per iteration, and vector-oriented array mapping. The algorithm has been incorporated into the electrostatic program DelPhi, reducing the required computing time by between one and two orders of magnitude. As a result the estimation of electrostatic effects such as solvent screening, ion distributions, and solvation energies of small solutes and biological macromolecules in solution, can be performed rapidly, and with minimal computing facilities.},
